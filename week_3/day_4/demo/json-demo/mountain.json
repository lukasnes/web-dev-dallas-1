"longDescription":"Only three centuries ago, setting out to climb a mountain would have been     considered close to lunacy. Mountains were places of peril, not beauty, an upper world     to be shunned, not sought out. Why do mountains now hold us spellbound, drawing us into     their dominion, often at the cost of our lives?    From Tibet to Australia, Alaska to Norway armed with drones, Go-Pros and helicopters,     director Jennifer Peedom has fashioned an astonishing symphony of mountaineers, ice climbers,     free soloists, heliskiers, snowboarders, wingsuiters and parachuting mountain bikers.     Willem Dafoe provides a narration sampled from British mountaineer Robert Macfarlane’s     acclaimed memoir Mountains of the Mind, and a classical score from the Australian Chamber     Orchestra accompanies this majestic cinematic experience."},

"description":"Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors.&#xa0;This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile.&#xa0;But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential.&#xa0;For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome.&#xa0;To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resiliance, and adjusting how we show up for the climb.&#xa0;In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves."},

"description":"<b>#1 <i>New York Times<\/i> bestselling authors Preston &amp; Child return in the latest installment of the bestselling series featuring renowned archaeologist Nora Kelly and FBI Agent Corrie Swanson, where a fateful trip to New Mexico uncovers a case that may prove impossible to solve.<\/b><br /><br /> In 2008, nine mountaineers failed to return from a winter backpacking trip in the New Mexico mountains. At their last campsite, searchers found a bizarre scene: something had appeared at the door of their tent so terrifying that it impelled them to slash their way out and flee barefoot to certain death in a blizzard. Despite a diligent search, only six bodies were found, two violently crushed and inexplicably missing body parts. The case, given the code name “Dead Mountain” by the FBI, was never solved. <br /><br /> Now, two more bodies from the lost expedition are unexpectedly discovered in a cave, one a grisly suicide. Young FBI Agent Corrie Swanson teams up with archaeologist Nora Kelly to investigate what really happened on that fateful trip fifteen years ago—and to find the ninth victim. But their search awakens a long-slumbering evil, which pursues Corrie and Nora with a vengeance, determined to prevent the final missing corpse from ever coming to light."},

"description":"<b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES <\/i>BESTSELLER • Everybody tells you to live for a cause larger than yourself, but how exactly do you do it? The author of&#xa0;<i>The Road to Character<\/i>&#xa0;explores what it takes to lead a meaningful life in a self-centered world.<\/b><br /><br /><b>“Deeply moving, frequently eloquent and extraordinarily incisive.”—<i>The Washington Post<\/i><\/b><br /><br /> Every so often, you meet people who radiate joy—who seem to know why they were put on this earth, who glow with a kind of inner light. Life, for these people, has often followed what we might think of as a two-mountain shape. They get out of school, they start a career, and they begin climbing the mountain they thought they were meant to climb. Their goals on this first mountain are the ones our culture endorses: to be a success, to make your mark, to experience personal happiness. But when they get to the top of that mountain, something happens. They look around and find the view . . . unsatisfying. They realize: This wasn’t my mountain after all. There’s another, bigger mountain out there that is actually <i>my<\/i> mountain.<br /><br /> And so they embark on a new journey. On the second mountain, life moves from self-centered to other-centered. They want the things that are truly worth wanting, not the things other people tell them to want. They embrace a life of interdependence, not independence. They surrender to a life of commitment.<br /><br /> In <i>The Second Mountain, <\/i>David Brooks explores the four commitments that define a life of meaning and purpose: to a spouse and family, to a vocation, to a philosophy or faith, and to a community. Our personal fulfillment depends on how well we choose and execute these commitments. Brooks looks at a range of people who have lived joyous, committed lives, and who have embraced the necessity and beauty of dependence. He gathers their wisdom on how to choose a partner, how to pick a vocation, how to live out a philosophy, and how we can begin to integrate our commitments into one overriding purpose.<br /><br /> In short, this book is meant to help us all lead more meaningful lives. But it’s also a provocative social commentary. We live in a society, Brooks argues, that celebrates freedom, that tells us to be true to ourselves, at the expense of surrendering to a cause, rooting ourselves in a neighborhood, binding ourselves to others by social solidarity and love. We have taken individualism to the extreme—and in the process we have torn the social fabric in a thousand different ways. The path to repair is through making deeper commitments.

"description":"We all want to maintain control over our lives: our relationships, our work, our health, even our moods. We want to know where we're going and what's going to happen when we get there. Letting going of knowing is hard because we think that if we don't know where we're going, we won't get there. Yet no matter how much we want to control life, it won't be controlled. But if grasping and manipulating doesn't work, what are we to do? Instead of putting our energy into trying to prevent life's upsets and spills, we can put that energy into being free within the upsets and spills. When we walk the path of awakening, we learn to master life rather than control it. Meditation practice is a means of opening our minds and hearts, allowing us to meet life on its own terms.<br /><br />Zen Buddhism emphasizes zazen, or seated meditation, as the means to study the self and understand who we truly are. Dharma talks are an essential aspect of Zen training and take place in the context of zazen. Said to be \"dark to the mind and radiant to the heart\", a dharma talk is one of the ways in which a teacher points directly to the heart of the teachings of the Buddha. In our meditation practice, it is easy to get lost in self-doubt, fantasy, numbness, and emotional agitation. Dharma talks help to ground our practice, providing inspiration and an essential recognition of exactly where we find ourselves, so that we can learn to face difficulties and obstacles with a free and flexible mind. This talk was given at Zen Mountain Monastery or the Zen Center of New York City of the Mountains and Rivers Order of Zen Buddhism, founded in 1980 by the late American Zen Master John Daido Loori, Roshi (1931-2009)."},

"description":"Shakyamuni Gautama was an historical figure who lived in India from approximately 563 to 483 B.C. After his death, Buddhism spread over Asia, and almost 2,500 years later Buddhism has come to the West, where it is more relevant than ever. These four classic talks by John Daido Loori, abbot of Zen Mountain Monastery, offer a clear, comprehensive version of the Buddha's life and teachings, including Buddha's life as a householder, spiritual seeker, and ultimately a teacher. Roshi brings Buddha to life by describing how Buddha's personal struggles led to his search for greater meaning. Like many of us, Buddha felt dissatisfied with the daily routine of life, and he wanted to understand how to live authentically. Buddha's search led to his realization of the Four Noble Truths, which are essentially the awareness of suffering and how to alleviate it. Daido Roshi discusses the Four Noble Truths, and examines how this core Buddhist teaching is relevant to our lives today. He also explores how subsequent teachers carried on the Buddha's teachings, touching particularly on Zen Buddhist masters. These talks form a wonderful introduction for those completely new to Buddhism, while offering important insights to those who are already practicing.<br /><br />Zen Buddhism emphasizes zazen, or seated meditation, as the means to study the self and understand who we truly are. Dharma talks are an essential aspect of Zen training and take place in the context of zazen. Said to be \"dark to the mind and radiant to the heart\", a dharma talk is one of the ways in which a teacher points directly to the heart of the teachings of the Buddha.

"description":"Coexisting but conflicting needs create self-sabotaging behaviors. This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile. But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential.&#xa0;<br /><br />For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb. In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves."},

"description":"From FOX News anchor and author Harris Faulkner comes a collection of powerful, true-life stories of resilience, healing, rescue, and protection.<br /><br />We need reminders of God’s power now more than ever.<br /><br />We often think about prayer as a wish list, with God as Santa Claus. The reality is that the power of prayer reminds us not only how small we are, but also how big God is. Prayer is hope put into action. And prayer works.<br /><br />From the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Haiti to the theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, believers testify to how God inspired hope even when all seemed lost.<br /><br />Two teenagers who were saved from treacherous seas by a vessel named Amen now give thanks for the rescue that changed their lives. A woman’s near-death experience with COVID-19 turned out to be the crisis freeing her from despair. Others speak to how prayer helped them navigate family trauma, overcome abuse, and cope with mental illness and depression. Historical accounts of miracles testify to God’s power throughout time, and Faulkner recounts the role of faith and prayer in her own life and the life of her father.<br /><br />Along with these stories of God’s presence, the book includes newly written prayers. Created to reflect the current times, These prayers provide a road map for putting the lessons of these stories into action.<br /><br />Faith Still Moves Mountains reminds us that God’s light always shines through the darkness.
